# Semifield

This program will implement a semifield, a field with no associative property, described in (Knuth. **Finite Semifields and Projective Planes**, 1965). We define addition, multiplication over this field, and will test different ways of defining exponentiation and try to come up with some conjectures about semifields.

This program was used for my Master's Thesis at Virginia Tech: May 18, 2000.
